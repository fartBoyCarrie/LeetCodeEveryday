# LeetCodeEveryday

Why?
I planned to create a personal programming project at first. After spending lots of time on trying to figure out which project I should start, I realized that currently I am not interested in any of the text based programs, 2D games, eventTracker-app or something like that... So for the purpose of practicing, leetcode is always a good place to go. 

How?
I will try to solve at least one problem on leetcode everyday and take notes on what I learned from that particular problem.

Who? When? How will this end?
Continuing...
